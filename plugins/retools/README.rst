REtools: Reverse Engineering UI
===============================

**Preliminary web UI for the OVMS3 RE toolkit**

Version 0.1 by Michael Balzer <dexter@dexters-web.de>

.. image:: retools-screenshot.png

This is a first implementation of a web frontend for the ``re`` commands.

You'll need some understanding of the ``re`` system, the UI lacks user guidance.
You can read about the ``re`` system on the developer list.

Feel free to improve and extend (and submit your results ;-)).
