       we only send metrics for which we have a value.
    b) New config settings:
         "updatetime.on" which sets updatetime when the car is on (driving)
         "updatetime.charging" which sets updatetime when the car is charging
         "updatetime.awake" which sets updatetime when the car is awake
       If unset the server uses the "idle" or "connected" interval as before
    c) New config setting "updatetime.sendall". If you set this we will publish
       _all_ valid metrics at this interval. Helpful to keep a steady flow of
       values for charting.
    PLEASE NOTE: These settings will increase OVMS' data usage.
