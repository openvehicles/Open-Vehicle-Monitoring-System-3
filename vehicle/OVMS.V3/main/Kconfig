        Duktape does a lot of small SPIRAM memory allocations for the heap,
        due to the Javascript memory management scheme leading to
        fragmentation of main memory and overall performance degradation.
        This option enables using a configurable dedicated chunk of SPIRAM
        memory for Duktape (config module duktape.heapsize). The memory
        management is implemented using the MIT licensed umm_malloc
        library by Ralph Hempel (https://github.com/rhempel/umm_malloc).
        
        NOTE: this is a workaround for the bad fragmentation handling of
        the esp-idf 3 memory allocator. esp-idf 4.3 includes a new memory
        allocator with better fragmentation handling, possibly eliminating

        The CANopen framework provides shell commands and a simple client API

        Stack size for the CANopen RX task ("COrx").
        The shared RX task triggers EMCY and NMT events and metrics updates
        so needs to be able to process the event/metrics listeners. If the
        listeners are simple, stack size can be reduced.
        Standard stack usage for the Twizy is currently around 2400 bytes.

        Stack size for CANopen worker tasks ("COwrk").
        Worker tasks only process TX jobs and don't trigger any event/metrics
        updates so can run with a smaller stack than the RX task.
        Standard stack usage for the Twizy is currently around 1000 bytes.
