.. [1] OVMS currently supports 2011-2017 Nissan LEAF and Nissan e-NV200

.. [2] Some HVAC Status Items have been only verified with 2013-2016 MY cars and will only work if the year is set in configuraiton. Also HVAC needs to be in ON position before powering down the vehicle for the metrics to work during pre-heat.

.. [3] Lock/Unlock will work if CAR can bus is awake, this can be activated by turning on A/C

.. [4] ZE0 (2011-2013) vehicles are required to choose SoC display from "relative to fixed value", "dashboard display" SoC method does not work with these vehicles.

Remote Climate Control
----------------------

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
2011-2013 models (ZE0)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gen1 Cars (ZE0, 2011-2013) require a hardware modification to enable remote climate control if the vehicle is not plugged in and charging. If you are ok with this, you don't need to do anything further.

If you want to to enable remote climate control once the charge has finished, or if the vehicle is not plugged in, you need to do the following hardware modification. You need to pull TCU pin 11 high (to 12v) to generate the "EV System Activation Request Signal", `more info <https://carrott.org/emini/Nissan_Leaf_OVMS#Remote_Climate_Control)>`_. Currently, the new v3 OVMS hardware does not have software support for doing this automatically. You can track the progress and find some more info (including about the old "RC3" pin), `here <https://github.com/openvehicles/Open-Vehicle-Monitoring-System-3/issues/607>`_.

If you have a "smart" EVSE (or one connected to a "smart" outlet, you can sometimes wake up the EV system by turning it off, then back on. This obviously only helps if your vehicle is plugged in, but may be useful for some users.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
2014-2016 models (AZE0)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use OVMS to activate remote climate the Nissan TCU (Telematics Control Unit) module must be unplugged if fitted (only on Acenta and Tekna models). The TCU is located behind the glovebox on LHD cars or on the right hand side of the drivers foot well on RHD cars. The large white plug on the rear of the TCU should be unplugged, push down tab in the middle and pull to unplug, `see video for RHD cars <https://photos.app.goo.gl/MuvpCaXQUjbCdoox6>`_ and `this page for LHD cars <http://www.arachnon.de/wb/pages/en/nissan-leaf/tcu.php>`_.

Note: Unplugging the TCU will disable Nissan EV connect / CARWINGS features e.g Nissan mobile app. All other car functions will not be effected e.g GPS, maps, radio, Bluetooth, microphone all work just the same as before. OVMS can be used to more than substitute the loss of Nissan Connect features. The TCU can be plugged back in at any point in the future if required.

OVMS remote climate support will 'just work' on LEAF Visia models and Visia/Acenta e-NV200 since these models do not have a TCU fitted.

Note: If you prefer not to unplug the Nissan TCU, all OVMS functions appart from remote climate will function just fine alongside the Nissan TCU.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
2016-2017 models (AZE0)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Remote climate control will only work when plugged in and actively charging on 2016-2017 models.** This is because in 2016 Nissan moved the TCU from the EV CAN bus to the CAR CAN bus.

Set the model year as follows and if necessary configure 30 kWh model:

``config set xnl modelyear 2016``

or

``config set xnl modelyear 2017``

*Note: in latest OVMS fimware version model year and battery size can be set via the web config interface.*

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
2018+ models (ZE1)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

2018+ 40/62kWh LEAF is not yet supported. Please get in touch if your interested in helping to add support. Relevant 2018 CANbus messages have already been decoded and documented, see `MyNissanLEAF thread <https://mynissanleaf.com/viewtopic.php?f=44&t=4131&start=480>`_.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Specific battery configs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For models with a 30 kWhr battery pack, set the capacity manually with:

``config set xnl maxGids 356``
``config set xnl newCarAh 79``

For models with a 40 kWhr battery pack, set the capacity manually with:

``config set xnl maxGids 502``
``config set xnl newCarAh 115``

For models with a 62 kWhr battery pack, set the capacity manually with:

``config set xnl maxGids 775``
``config set xnl newCarAh 176``

*Note: In latest OVMS firmware version, model year and battery size can be set via the web config interface. This is easier and also the preferred method.*

*Note 2: OVMS fully supports battery upgraded LEAFs, just set the capacity according to what battery is currently installed.*

-----------------
Range Calculation
-----------------

The OVMS uses two configuration options to calculate remaining range, whPerGid (default 80Wh/gid) and kmPerKWh (default 7.1km/kWh). The range calculation is based on the remaining gids reported by the LBC and at the moment does not hold 5% in reserve like LeafSpy. Feedback on this calculation is welcomed.

-----------------
Resources
-----------------

- Nissan LEAF support added by Tom Parker, see `his wiki <https://carrott.org/emini/Nissan_Leaf_OVMS>`_ for lots of documentation and resources. Some info is outdated e.g climate control now turns off automatically.
- Nissan LEAF features are being added by Jaunius Kapkan, see `his github profile <https://github.com/mjkapkan/Open-Vehicle-Monitoring-System-3>`_ to track the progress.
- `MyNissanLEAF thread for Nissan CANbus decoding discussion <http://www.mynissanleaf.com/viewtopic.php?f=44&t=4131&hilit=open+CAN+discussion&start=440>`_
- Database files (.DBC) for ZE0 and AZE0 Leaf can be found here: `Github LEAF Canbus database files <https://github.com/dalathegreat/leaf_can_bus_messages>`_

Assistance is appreciated as I haven't had time to try to override the TCU using the OVMS or find an alternative solution to prevent the TCU overriding the messages while still allowing the hands free microphone to work.
