VW e-Up via OBD2
================

Vehicle Type: **VWUP.OBD**

This vehicle type supports the VW e-UP (new model from year 2020 onwards). Untested (so far) but probably working: The older models of the e-Up as well as Skoda Citigo E IV and Seat MII electric.

Connection is via the standard OBD-II port (above the drivers left foot):

All communication with the car is read-only. For changing values (i.e. climate control) see the T26A connection to the Comfort CAN bus.

Vehicle States
--------------

.. warning::
  For proper state detection, the **12V calibration is crucial**.
  Calibrate using the OVMS Web UI: Config → Vehicle → 12V Monitor

Three vehicle states are supported and detected automatically:

**Vehicle ON**
  The car is on: It is drivable.

**Vehicle CHARGING**
  The car is charging: The car's Charger ECU is responsive and reports charging activity.

**Vehicle OFF**
  The car is off: It hasn't drawn (or charged) any current into the main battery for a 
  period of time and the 12V battery voltage is smaller than 12.9V.

Custom Metrics

In addition to the standard metrics above the following custom metrics are read from the car or internally calculated by OVMS using read values.

**State metrics**

======================================== ======================== ============================================


**Timed charge metrics**

======================================== ======================== ============================================
Metric name                              Example value            Description
======================================== ======================== ============================================
xvu.c.limit.soc.max                      80%                      Charge schedule maximum SOC
xvu.c.limit.soc.min                      20%                      Charge schedule minimum SOC
xvu.c.timermode.def                      yes                      Charge timer defined & default
======================================== ======================== ============================================

``xvu.c.timermode.def`` tells if a charge schedule has been configured and enabled. If so, the car uses timed
charging by default (the charge mode button will be lit). ``v.c.timermode`` tells if the charge timer is or will
actually be used for the current or next charge, i.e. reflects the mode selected by pushing the button.

With timed charging, the car first charges to the minimum SOC as soon as possible (when connected). If the
maximum SOC configured for the schedule hasn't been reached by then, it will then wait for the timer to signal
the second phase to charge up to the maximum SOC. The "sufficient SOC" ``v.c.limit.soc`` will be the maximum
SOC if less than 100%. If the timer is disabled or set to charge up to 100%, the sufficient SOC is set to the
user configured charge time prediction SOC limit (config ``xvu ctp.soclimit``).

Charging above ``v.c.limit.soc`` is classified as the "topping off" charge phase. When crossing that SOC
threshold, an intermediate charge status notification is sent.

Note: ``xvu.c.limit.soc.min`` will show the configured minimum SOC also if no schedule is currently enabled.
``xvu.c.limit.soc.max`` shows the maximum for the current/next schedule to apply. If no schedule is enabled,
it will be zero.

.. [3] Only supplied by ECU when the car ignition is on during charging.

.. [4] These are not measurements by the car but provided as is by the charger and typically deviate from
  the battery metrics. According to IEC 61851, CCS currents may be off by +/- 3% and voltages by +/- 5%. The
  power figures displayed by some chargers also typically won't match these values, possibly because the charger
  displays the power drawn from the grid (including losses).


----------------------
Battery Capacity & SOH
----------------------

=============== ===================== ================================
e-Up Model      Total capacity        Usable capacity
=============== ===================== ================================
Gen 1 (2016)    18.7 kWh / 50 Ah      16.4 kWh / 43.9 Ah (87.7%)
Gen 2 (2020)    36.8 kWh / 120 Ah     32.3 kWh / 105.3 Ah (87.7%)
=============== ===================== ================================

There are currently two ways to get an estimation of the remaining capacity of the e-Up:

1. By deriving a usable energy capacity from the MFD range estimation.
2. By deriving a total coulomb capacity from the coulombs charged.

You can configure which of the estimations you want to use as the standard SOH from the
"Features" web page or by setting the config parameter ``xvu bat.soh.source`` to either
``charge`` (default) or ``range``.

.. note:: **Consider the capacity estimations as experimental / preliminary.**
  We need field data to optimize the readings. If you'd like to help us, see below.

The **MFD range estimation** seems to include some psychological factors with an SOC below 30%, so we 
only provide this and the derived capacity in two custom metrics. The capacity derivation is only
calculated with SOC >= 30% (initial value needs SOC >= 70%), but if so is available immediately 
after switching the car on. This can serve as a quick first estimation, relate it to the usable 
capacity of your model.

The range based SOH is taken at it's maximum peaks observed and copied if higher than the
previously observed value or added smoothed if lower. So to take the next reading directly,
set metric ``xvu.b.soh.range`` to 0 before switching on the car.

The **charge coulomb based estimation** provides a better estimation but will need a little more 
time to settle. Usable measurements need charges of at least 30% SOC, the more the better. Estimations
are only calculated if a charge has exceeded 30% SOC, and results are smoothed over multiple charges
to provide stable readings.

- To get a rough capacity estimation, charge at least 30% normalized SOC difference.
- To get a good capacity estimation, do at least three charges with each covering 60%
  or more normalized SOC difference.

Charging by CCS (DC) apparently yields higher results, especially on the energy estimations. We
don't know yet the reason or if we need to compensate this.

Note: the **SOH** (state of health) is currently coupled directly and solely to the calculated 
amp-hour capacity **CAC**.


To **log your capacity data** on a connected V2 server, do::

  OVMS# config set xvu log.chargecap.storetime 30

30 is the number of days to keep the data, set to 0 to disable. The counters will be stored in table
``XVU-LOG-ChargeCap``, with one entry every 2.4% absolute SOC difference. Resulting CAC/SOH updates 
will be logged in table ``XVU-LOG-ChargeCapSOH``. You can also extract the data from your module
log file by filtering lines matching ``ChargeCap``.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Provide Data to the Developers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To help us with optimizing the capacity estimations, first of all enable file logging if not already 
enabled. Then enable extended polling and logging before a charge by…::

  OVMS# config set xvu dc_interval 30
  OVMS# log level verbose v-vweup

After the charge, disable the extended polling and logging::

  OVMS# config set xvu dc_interval 0
  OVMS# log level info v-vweup

Then download all log files written during the charge (archived and current), zip them and mail
the zip to Michael Balzer <dexter@dexters-web.de>. The log data will only be used for technical 
analysis and deleted afterwards.

Note: if you forgot enabling the local log but still have chargecap logs on the server: these can help
as well.

**Thanks!**


-----------------------
Configuration Variables
-----------------------

The main configuration variables can be set through the web configuration page:

- VW e-Up → Features

Some configuration variables are kept "under the hood", as these will normally not need to be
changed, except for some special use cases or for development / debugging.

Configuration variables can be listed using command ``config list xvu`` and changed using
command ``config set xvu <variable> <value>``.

  reduce the value.


--------------
Shell Commands
--------------

- ``xvu polling <status|pause|continue>`` -- control OBD2 polling
  
  The OBD2 polling is normally continuously active as long as the vehicle module is loaded.
  To free the CAN bus from this load during an extended OBD2 diagnostics or modification
  (coding / adaptation) session, you can temporarily pause the polling using this command.
  
  There is no time limit for a pause, keep in mind you need to explicitly continue the
  polling when you're done. During a polling pause, no vehicle state changes can be detected.



-----------------------------
Custom Status Page for Web UI
-----------------------------

.. note::
  This plugin is obsolete, use the standard page **VW e-Up → Charging Metrics** instead.
  We keep the source here as a base for user customization.

The easiest way to display custom metrics is using the *Web Plugins* feature of OVMS (see :ref:`installing-web-plugins`).

This page plugin content shows the metrics in a compact form which can be displayed on a phone in landscape mode on the dashboard of the car. Best approach is to connect the phone directly to the OVMS AP-WiFi and access the web UI via the static IP (192.168.4.1) of OVMS.
