ISOTP Poller Basics
===================

The Poller module has been lifted from the vehicle implementation. It supports periodic
polling of OBD addresses, both older style (type 9 like those used for HUDs) and the newer
ISOTP (and VWTP) multi-framed data protocol extensions.

As it stands it is primarily a developer API with limited controls over the parameters.
