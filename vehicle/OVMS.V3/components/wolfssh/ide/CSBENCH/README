This is to build with Sourcery CodeBench IDE

It makes the assumption that the root wolfssl and wolfssh directory are in the same folder

workspace ->
    ->wolfssl
    ->wolfssh

To build first compile the wolfssl library using the project provided in wolfssl/IDE/CSBENCH

Next compile the sftp example project provided in wolfssh/ide/CSBENCH

Note that this is using port 8080 to listen on by default
