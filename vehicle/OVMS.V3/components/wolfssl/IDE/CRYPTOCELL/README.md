# ARM速 TrustZone速 CryptoCell 310 Port
## Overview
ARM速 TrustZone速 CryptoCell 310 is a security subsystem which provides root of trust (RoT) and cryptographic services for a device.
You can enable the wolfSSL support for ARM CryptoCell using the `#define WOLFSSL_CRYPTOCELL`, The CryptoCell APIs are distributed as part of the Nordic nRF5 SDKs [here](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.nordic.infocenter.sdk5.v15.0.0%2Fgroup__cryptocell__api.html) .

## Prerequisites
1. Follow the Nordic website [here](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Software/nRF5-SDK) to download the Nordic nRF5-SDK and software tools.
2. Install the SEGGER Embedded Studio IDE.
3. Run a simple blinky application on your Nordic nRF52840 (PCA10056) development board to confirm that your board functions as expected and the communication between your computer and the board works.

## Usage
You can start with a wolfcrypt SEGGER embedded studio (ses) example project to integrate the wolfSSL source code.
wolfSSL supports a compile-time user configurable options in the `IDE/CRYPTOCELL/user_settings.h` file.

The `IDE/CRYPTOCELL/main.c` example application provides a function to run the selected examples at compile time through the following two #defines in user_settings.h. You can define these macro options to disable the test run.
```
- #undef NO_CRYPT_TEST
- #undef NO_CRYPT_BENCHMARK
```

## Supported features
- SHA-256
- AES CBC
- CryptoCell 310 RNG
- RSA sign/verify and RSA key gen (2048 bit in PKCSv1.5 padding mode)
- RSA encrypt/decrypt
- ECC sign/verify/shared secret
- ECC key import/export and key gen pairs
- Hardware RNG
- RTC for benchmark timing source

Note: All Cryptocell features are not supported. The wolfcrypt RSA API allows import and export of Private/Public keys in DER format. However, this is not possible with key pairs generated with Cryptocell because the importing/exporting Cryptocell keys has not been implemented yet.

## Setup
### Setting up Nordic SDK with wolfSSL
1. Download the wolfSSL source code or a zip file from GitHub and place it under your SDK `InstallFolder/external/` directory. You can also copy or simlink to the source.
```
  For example,

  $cd ~/nRF5_SDK_15.2.0_9412b96/external
  $git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl.git

  Or, assuming you have already cloned the wolfSSL source code under ~/wolfssl.

  $cd ~/nRF5_SDK_15.2.0_9412b96/external
  $ln -s  ~/wolfssl wolfssl
```
2. Copy the example project from [here](https://github.com/tmael/nRF5_SDK/tree/master/examples/crypto/nrf_cc310/wolfcrypt) into your `nRF5_SDK_15.2.0_9412b96/examples/crypto/nrf_cc310/` directory.
```
  $git clone https://github.com/tmael/nRF5_SDK.git
  $cd ~/nRF5_SDK_15.2.0_9412b96/examples/crypto/nrf_cc310

  $cp -rf ~/nRF5_SDK/examples/crypto/nrf_cc310/wolfcrypt .
  OR
  $ln -s ~/nRF5_SDK/examples/crypto/nrf_cc310/wolfcrypt wolfcrypt
```
3. Launch the SEGGER Embedded Studio IDE
4. In the main menu, go to File >Open Solutions to open the example solution. Browse to the location containing the wolfcrypt code `/examples/crypto/nrf_cc310/wolfcrypt/pca10056/blank/ses/wolfcrypt_pca10056.emProject` and choose Open.

## Building and Running
In the main menu, go to Build > Rebuild your project, then load and run your image on your nRF52840 target platform. Review the test results on the console output.

### `wolfcrypt_test()`
wolfcrypt_test() prints a message on the target console similar to the following output:
```

### `benchmark_test()`
benchmark_test() prints a message on the target console similar to the following output.
