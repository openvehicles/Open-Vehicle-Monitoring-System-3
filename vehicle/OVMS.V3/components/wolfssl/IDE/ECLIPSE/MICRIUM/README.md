# Micrium μC/OS-III Port
## Overview
You can enable the wolfSSL support for Micrium μC/OS-III RTOS available [here](http://www.micrium.com/) using the define `MICRIUM`.

## Usage

You can start with your IDE-based example project for Micrium uC/OS-III and uC/TCPIP stack. You must include the uC-Clk module into your project because wolfSSL uses Micrium’s Clk_GetTS_Unix () function from <clk.h> in order to authenticate the start and end dates of certificates.

wolfSSL supports a compile-time user configurable options in the `IDE/ECLIPSE/MICRIUM/user_settings.h` file.

The `wolfsslRunTests.c` example application provides a simple function to run the selected examples at compile time through the following four #defines in user_settings.h.

```
       1. #define WOLFSSL_WOLFCRYPT_TEST
       2. #define WOLFSSL_BENCHMARK_TEST
       3. #define WOLFSSL_CLIENT_TEST
       4. #define WOLFSSL_SERVER_TEST

You can define one or all of the above options.
```
1. Open your IDE-based example project for Micrium uC/OS-III (with the uC-Clk module) and uC/TCPIP stack.

2. Create the following folder and sub-folders structures in your project.
```
wolfssl
   |src
   |wolfcrypt
          |benchmark
          |src
          |test
   |wolfssl
          |openssl
          |wolfcrypt
   |exampleTLS
```
The folder hierarchy is the same as the wolfSSL folders with an exception of the exampleTLS folder.

3. Right click on the exampleTLS folder, add or link all of the header and source files in `IDE/ECLIPSE/MICRIUM/` folder into the exampleTLS folder.

4. Right click on each folders, add or link all the source code in the corresponding folder in wolfSSL.

5. Remove non-C platform dependent files from your build. At the moment, only aes_asm.asm and aes_asm.s must be removed from your wolfssl/wolfcrypt/src folder.

6. In your C/C++ compiler preprocessor settings, add the wolfSSL directories to your include paths.
Here's an example of the paths that must be added.
```
$PROJ_DIR$\...
$PROJ_DIR$\...\wolfcrypt
$PROJ_DIR$\...\wolfssl
$PROJ_DIR$\...\IDE\ECLIPSE\MICRIUM
```
7. In your C/C++ compiler preprocessor settings, define the WOLFSSL_USER_SETTINGS symbol to add user_settings.h file in your project.

8. Add a call to `wolfsslRunTests()` from your startup task. Here's an example:
```
static  void  App_TaskStart (void *p_arg)
{
    OS_ERR  os_err;
    ...
    while (DEF_TRUE) {
           wolfsslRunTests();
           OSTimeDlyHMSM(0u, 5u, 0u, 0u,OS_OPT_TIME_HMSM_STRICT, &os_err);
        }
}
```
9. Rebuild all your project.

10. Now you are ready to download and debug your image on the board.

The test results below were collected from the NXP Kinetis K70 (Freescale TWR-K70F120M MCU) tower system board with the following software and tool chains:

- IAR Embedded Workbench IDE - ARM 8.32.1 (IAR ELF Linker V8.32.1.169/W32 for ARM)

- The starting project is based on an IAR EWARM project from Micrium download center at [micrium_twr-k70f120m-os3/](https://www.micrium.com/download/micrium_twr-k70f120m-os3/) but the K70X_FLASH.icf linker script file was slightly modified to configure the stack and heap sizes to 16KB and 20KB. The test was run on a 1 MBytes of program flash and 128 KBytes of static RAM. ([Similar TCP version](https://www.micrium.com/download/twr-k70f120m_os3-tcpip-wifi-lib/))

### `WOLFSSL_CLIENT_TEST` wolfssl_client_test()

You can modify the `TCP_SERVER_IP_ADDR` and `TCP_SERVER_PORT` macros at top of the `client_wolfssl.c` file to configure the host address and port. You will also need the server certificate. This example uses TLS 1.2 to connect to a remote host.

### `WOLFSSL_SERVER_TEST` wolfssl_server_test()

You can modify the `TLS_SERVER_PORT` at top of `server_wolfssl.c` to configure the port number to listen on local-host.

Once you start the TLS server and `Listening for client connection` displays on the serial console, the server is ready to accept client connections.

You can connect to the server using the wolfssl TLS client example from your Linux or Windows host as follows:

$ ./examples/client/client.exe -h TLS_SERVER_IP_ADDRES
SSL version is TLSv1.2
SSL cipher suite is TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
SSL curve name is SECP256R1
I hear ya fa shizzle!
