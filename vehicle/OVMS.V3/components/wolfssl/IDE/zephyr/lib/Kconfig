menuconfig WOLFSSL
	bool "wolfSSL Support"
	help
	  This option enables the wolfSSL cryptography library.

	prompt "Select implementation"
	default WOLFSSL_BUILTIN

config WOLFSSL_BUILTIN
	bool "Enable wolfSSL integrated sources"
	help
	  Link with local wolfSSL sources instead of external library.

config WOLFSSL_LIBRARY
	bool "Enable wolfSSL external library"
	help
	  This option enables wolfSSL library.

endchoice

config WOLFSSL_SETTINGS_FILE
	string "wolfSSL settings file"
	depends on WOLFSSL_BUILTIN
	default "user_settings-tls-generic.h"
	help
	  Use a specific wolfSSL settings file. The default config file
	  file can be tweaked with Kconfig. The default settings is
	  suitable to communicate with majority of HTTPS servers on the Internet,
	  but has relatively many features enabled. To optimize resources for
	  special TLS usage, use available Kconfig settings, or select an
	  alternative config.

config WOLFSSL_DEBUG
	bool "wolfSSL debug activation"
	depends on WOLFSSL_BUILTIN
	help
	  Enable debugging activation for wolfSSL configuration. If you use
	  wolfSSL/Zephyr integration (e.g. net_app), this will activate debug
	  logging (of the level configured by WOLFSSL_DEBUG_LEVEL).

config WOLFSSL_INSTALL_PATH
	string "wolfSSL install path"
	depends on WOLFSSL_LIBRARY
	help
	  This option holds the path where the wolfSSL libraries and headers are
	  installed. Make sure this option is properly set when WOLFSSL_LIBRARY
	  is enabled otherwise the build will fail.

config APP_LINK_WITH_WOLFSSL
	bool "Link 'app' with WOLFSSL"
	default y
	depends on WOLFSSL
	help
	  Add WOLFSSL header files to the 'app' include path. It may be
	  disabled if the include paths for WOLFSSL are causing aliasing
	  issues for 'app'.
