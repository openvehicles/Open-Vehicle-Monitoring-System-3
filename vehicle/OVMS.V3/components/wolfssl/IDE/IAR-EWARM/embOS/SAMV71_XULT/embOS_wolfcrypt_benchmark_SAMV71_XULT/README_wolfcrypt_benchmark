Steps taken to evaluate wolfSSL with the following:

Required Software for this guide:
IAR Embedded Workbench IDE - ARM v7.60.1 (or similar version)
embOS v4.16 (for Cortex-M and IAR compiler)
wolfssl (latest version)

Required items (Hardware) for this guide:
Atmel SAM V71 Xplained Ultra (Or equivalent Cortex-M Evaluation Board)
    Note: Must have J-Trace adapter (SWD or SWD + ETM)
j-Trace for ARM Cortex-M Processors
    Note: You can see here: https://www.segger.com/j-trace-for-cortex-m.html
    Note: You can also purchase other models, we used one from IAR v3.2
20 pin target ribbon cable
USB Cable with j-Trace adapter end
Micro usb cable

#--!! NOTE !!--#
For this guide "**SAMV71_DIR" will signify the directory:
C:\<path-to>\wolfssl\IDE\IAR-EWARM\embOS\SAMV71_XULT\

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# Setup file system to evaluate wolfssl  in embOS project:
# (If you have not already done so)
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------#

1. In wolfssl you will notice the directory:
    wolfssl\IDE\IAR-EWARM\embOS\extract_trial_here

2. go to embOS website and download a trial for your platform
   https://www.segger.com/downloads/embos ->
                                      embOS trial for Cortex-M and IAR compiler

3. Extract (unzip) the download to
    C:\<path-to>\wolfssl\IDE\IAR-EWARM\embOS\extract_trial_here\
    (Note: you do not need to do anything further in this directory, the
      wolfSSL evaluation projects will simply link against it)
	  
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# Evaluate wolfcrypt_benchmarks in embOS project:
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------#

1. In IAR Workbench go to Project -> Add Existing Project
    a. Browse to **SAMV71_DIR\embOS_wolfcrypt_benchmark_SAMV71_XULT\
    b. Choose wolfcrypt_benchmark.ewp and click "Open"

2. Go to Project -> Rebuild All

3. Connect your SAMV71 Xplained Ultra to your PC with micro USB in the "Debug"
   port for power and the J-Link hooked up to SWD pins and your PC

4. Go to Project -> Download and Debug

5. Once the "Debug" environment has loaded go to: View -> Terminal I/O
   (This is where the printf's will be directed to)

6. Hit "Go" (Debug option with 3 right arrows "→→→")

7. You should observe the benchmark times for the configured algorithms.
