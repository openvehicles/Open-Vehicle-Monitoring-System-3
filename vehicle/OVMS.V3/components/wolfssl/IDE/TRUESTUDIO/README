wolfSSL Example Project for Atollic TrueSTUDIO

This directory contains an example wolfSSL static library project for
Atollic TrueSTUDIO.

The "wolfssl" TrueSTUDIO project has been set up to compile a generic
static library for ARM Cortex-M4 devices.  This can be configured
and changed in the project properties window.

Steps to compile this project:

1. Open Atollic TrueSTUDIO
2. Import project into workspace (File->Import)
3. Build project (Project->Build Project)

This project defines WOLFSSL_USER_SETTINGS in the C/C++ Compiler
toolchain preprocessor symbols.  This causes wolfSSL to look for and
include a "user_settings.h" file at build time.  This header controls
how the wolfSSL library is compiled.

The existing "user_settings.h" file is very minimal and users should
modify it to meet the requirements and specifics of their projects.
