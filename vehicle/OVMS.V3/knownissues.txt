Open Vehicle Monitor System v3 - Known issues

* Wifi APCLIENT mode is to be considered experimental.

* SSH, TELNET, and WEBSERVER all register listeners for incoming calls. There
  is a possible security issue here as those calls may come over cellular
  networks (not just wifi). There is no firewalling of these calls. It seems
  that the correct approach to this is to validate the destination IP to
  make sure it is a wifi interface IP address; but this is not currently
  done.

* Bluetooth is not currently supported.

* Vehicle: Kyburz not currently implemented in 3.x.

* Vehicle: NissanLeaf:
  * Remote telemetry wake-up for pre-2016 vehicles not currently supported
    (as required hardware wakeup circuit).
  * 2018 Nissan leaf not currently supported.

* Vehicle: Tazzari not currently implemented in 3.x.

* Vehicle: Think City not currently implemented in 3.x.

* Vehicle: Volt/Ampera only partially implemented in 3.x.

* Vehicle: Renault Zoe not currently implemented in 3.x.

* Advanced Charge control not currently implemented in 3.x.
  Note that scripting can go someway towards providing equivalent functionality.

* SMS to command gateway is not currently implemented.

* SMS notifications are not currently implemented.
