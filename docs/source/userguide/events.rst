Events
======

Internally, OVMS raises events whenever significant events occur. An event is a lightweight message
of a name plus optionally associated internal binary data. Event names are top-down structured (so
can be filtered by prefix) and sufficient to identify the source and type of the event. Individual
vehicle types may also issue their own events, and custom user events are also possible.

To **bind a script to an event**, save the script in directory ``/store/events/<eventname>`` (hint:
directories can be created using the web UI editor). Whenever events are triggered, all the scripts
in the corresponding ``/store/events/<eventname>`` directory are executed. Event scripts are
executed in alphanumerical order of their names. Good practice is to prefix script names with 2-3
digit numbers in steps of 10 or 100 (i.e. first script named ``50-…``), so new scripts can easily be
integrated at a specific place. If the event script is written in Javascript, be sure to add the
suffix ``.js`` to the name. Other names will be executed using the standard command interpreter.

If you want to **introduce a custom event** (e.g. for a plugin), prefix the event name by
``usr.<pluginname>.`` followed by the event purpose. :doc:`../components/ovms_script/docs/foglight`

Be aware **events are processed in series** from a queue, so depending on the system load and the
list of registered event listeners, there may be some delay from event generation to e.g. a script
execution.

--------
Commands
--------

- ``event list [<key>]`` -- Show registered listeners for all or events matching a key
  (part of the name)
- ``event trace <on|off>`` -- Enable/disable logging of events at the "info" level.
  Without tracing, events are also logged, but at the "debug" level.
  Ticker events are never logged.
- ``event raise [-d<delay_ms>] <event>`` -- Manually raise an event, optionally with a delay.
  You can raise any event you like, but you shouldn't raise system events without
  good knowledge of their effects.
