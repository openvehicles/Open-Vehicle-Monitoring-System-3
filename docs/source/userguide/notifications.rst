=============
Notifications
=============

Notifications can be simple text messages or transport structured data. To distinguish by their 
purpose and origin, notifications have a **type** and a **subtype**.

Notifications are sent by the module via the available communication **channels** (client/server 
connections). If a channel is temporarily down (e.g. due to a connection loss), the notifications 
for that channel will be kept in memory until the channel is available again. (Note: this message 
queue does not survive a crash or reboot of the module.)

Channels process notifications differently depending on the way they work. For 
example, a v2 server will forward text notifications as push messages to connected smart phones 
and email readers, a v3 server will publish them under an MQTT topic, and the webserver will 
display the message as a modal dialog. See the respective manual sections for details.


**Notification types currently defined:**

  - ``info`` -- informational text messages
  - ``alert`` -- alert text messages
  - ``error`` -- error code messages
  - ``data`` -- historical data records, usually CSV formatted
  - ``stream`` -- live data streaming (high bandwidth), usually JSON formatted

The standard subtypes used are listed below, these can be used to filter messages. Vehicles may 
introduce custom notifications and replace standard notifications, see the respective user guide 
section for details.

Subtypes by convention are given in lower case, with dots ''.'' as structural separators.


**Notification channels currently defined:**

  - ``ovmsv2`` -- server v2 connection
  - ``ovmsv3`` -- server v3 connection
  - ``ovmsweb`` -- websocket connections
  - ``pushover`` -- pushover text messaging service

Channels may have multiple active instances ("readers"), for example you can open multiple websocket
connections. Channels may exclude notification types. Currently ``stream`` records are only 
supported on a websocket connection, all other types are supported on all channels.

Use ``notify status`` to see the currently registered channels ("readers"). Example::

  OVMS# notify status
  Notification system has 3 readers registered
    pushover(1): verbosity=1024
    ovmsv2(2): verbosity=1024
    ovmsweb(3): verbosity=65535
  Notify types:
    alert: 0 entries
    data: 0 entries
    error: 0 entries
    info: 0 entries
    stream: 0 entries

The channel's "verbosity" defines the supported maximum length of a textual notification message 
on that channel. Notification senders *should* honor this, but not all may do so. If 
messages exceed this limit, they may be truncated.


---------------------
Sending notifications
---------------------

You can send custom notifications from the shell or command scripts by using the ``notify raise`` 
command. The command can send the output of another command, an error code (implies type ``error``), 
or any text you enter. For example, to send a custom text message, do::

  OVMS# notify raise text info usr.anton.welcome "Hello, wonderful person!"

In this case, the type would be ``info`` and the subtype ``usr.anton.welcome``. The type must match 
one of the defined types, the subtype can be chosen arbitrarily. Please use a unique ``usr.`` 
prefix for custom notifications to avoid collisions.

To send a battery status command result, do::

  OVMS# notify raise command info battery.status "stat"

To send notifications from Duktape scripts, use the API call ``OvmsNotify.Raise()``.


----------------------
Suppress notifications
----------------------

You can filter the channels to be used for notifications by their subtypes. By default, no 
subtypes are filtered on any channel, so all notifications are sent to all clients.

To disable (suppress) notifications, create a config entry based on the respective subtype, 
that lists the channels to include or exclude::

  OVMS# config set notify <subtype> <channels>

<channels> options are:
  a) explicit inclusion: e.g. ``ovmsv2,pushover`` (only enable these)
  b) explicit exclusion: e.g. ``*,-ovmsv3,-ovmsweb`` (only disable these)
  c) ``-`` (dash) to disable all
  d) empty/``*`` to enable all

**Example**: to disable the OTA update notifications on all channels, do::

  OVMS# config set notify ota.update -

Grid history log
----------------

The grid history log can be used as a source for long term statistics on your charges and typical 
energy usages and to calculate your vehicle energy costs.

Log entries are created on each change of the charge or generator state (``v.c.state`` / ``v.g.state``).

You need to enable this log explicitly by configuring a storage time via config param ``notify 
log.grid.storetime`` (in days) or via the web configuration page. Set to 0/empty to disable the log. 
Already stored log entries will be kept on the server until expiry or manual deletion.

Note: the stability of the total energy counters included in this log depends on their source 
and persistence on the vehicle and/or module. If they are kept on the module, they may lose their
values on a power outage.

Trip history log
----------------

The trip history log can be used as a source for long term statistics on your trips and typical 
trip power usages, as well as your battery performance in different environmental conditions and 
degradation over time.

Entries are created at the beginning and end of each "ignition" cycle (``v.e.on`` change). Configure 
a minimum trip length for logging by the config variable ``notify log.trip.minlength`` or via the web 
UI. If your vehicle does not support the ``v.p.trip`` metric, set the minimum trip length to 0.

The log entry at the beginning of a trip is created to track non-driving SOC changes, vampire drains
and BMS SOC corrections that occurred in between. If you're just interested in the actual drive results,
filter the records e.g. by ``pos_trip > 0.1`` or ``env_drivetime > 10`` (by default log entries
will be created 3 seconds after the ``v.e.on`` state change).

You need to enable this log explicitly by configuring a storage time via config param ``notify 
log.trip.storetime`` (in days) or via the web configuration page. Set to 0/empty to disable the log. 
Already stored log entries will be kept on the server until expiry or manual deletion.

-----------
Trip report
-----------

The trip report outputs some core statistics of the current or most recent trip (drive
cycle). It can be queried any time using the ``stat trip`` command, or be configured to
be sent automatically on turning the vehicle off:

Use the web UI (Config → Notifications) or set config variable ``notify report.trip.enable`` to
``yes`` and optionally a minimum trip length in ``notify log.trip.minlength`` (defaults to 0.2 km).
If your vehicle does not support the ``v.p.trip`` metric, set the minimum trip length to 0.

The statistics available depend on your vehicle type (i.e. metrics support of that vehicle
adaption). Vehicles also may override the report to provide custom statistics. By default,
a full trip report will contain:

  - Trip length
  - Average driving speed
  - Overall altitude difference (start to end point)
  - Energy consumption in Wh per km/Mi
  - Recuperation percentage (in relation to energy used)
  - SOC difference & new SOC
  - Estimated range difference & new range
  - Average acceleration & deceleration

The average driving speed is calculated only from speeds above 5 kph (3 mph)
(to exclude slow speed rolling), and the acceleration & deceleration averages
exclude values below 2.5 kph/s (1.6 mph/s) (constant speed cruising).
