---------------------------

This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class B digital device,
pursuant to part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection
against harmful interference in a residential installation. This equipment generates, uses and
can radiate radio frequency energy and, if not installed and used in accordance with the
instructions, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. However, there is no
guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation. If this equipment
does cause harmful interference to radio or television reception, which can be determined by
turning the equipment off and on, the user is encouraged to try to correct the interference
by one or more of the following measures:

  - Reorient or relocate the receiving antenna.
  - Increase the separation between the equipment and receiver.
  - Connect the equipment into an outlet on a circuit different from that to which the receiver is connected.
  - Consult the dealer or an experienced radio/TV technician for help.

Caution: Any changes or modiﬁcations to this device not explicitly approved by manufacturer
could void your authority to operate this equipment.

This device complies with part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject to the following two conditions:
(1) This device may not cause harmful interference, and (2) this device must accept any interference
received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.

OVMS-33-7600G Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) information
--------------------------------------------------------

This OVMS-33-7600G meets the government's requirements for exposure to radio
waves. The guidelines are based on standards that were developed by independent
scientific organizations through periodic and thorough evaluation of scientific studies.
The standards include a substantial safety margin designed to assure the safety of all
persons regardless of age or health. FCC RF Exposure Information and Statement
the SAR limit of USA (FCC) is 1.6 W/kg averaged over one gram of tissue. Device
types: OVMS-33-7600G has also been tested against this SAR limit. This device
was tested for typical body-worn operations with the back of the phone kept 0mm
from the body. To maintain compliance with FCC RF exposure requirements, use
accessories that maintain an 0mm separation distance between the user's body and
the back of the phone. The use of belt clips, holsters and similar accessories should
not contain metallic components in its assembly. The use of accessories that do not
satisfy these requirements may not comply with FCC RF exposure requirements, and
should be avoided.

General Warnings
----------------

.. image:: warning.png

  :align: left

| **Warning!**
| OVMS is a hobbyist project, not a commercial product. It was designed by enthusiasts for enthusiasts. Installation and use of this module requires some technical knowledge, and if you don't have that we recommend you contact other users in your area to ask for assistance.

.. image:: warning.png
  :width: 100px
  :align: left
  
| **Warning!**
| The OVMS module is continuously powered by the car, even when the car is off.
  While the OVMS module uses extremely low power, it does continuously draw power from the
  car's battery, so it will contribute to 'vampire' power drains.

Do not allow your car battery to reach 0% SOC, and if it does, plug in and charge the car
immediately. **Failure to do this can result in unrecoverable failure of the car's battery.**

The module can monitor the main and 12V battery and send alert notifications if the SOC or
voltage drops below a healthy level.


-------------------
Average Power Usage
-------------------

The power used by the module depends on the component activation. You can save power by
disabling unused components. This can be done automatically by the Power Management module
to avoid deep discharging the 12V battery, or you can use scripts to automate switching
components off and on.

The base components need approximately these power levels continuously while powered on:

================ ========== ============
Component         Avg Power  12V Current
================ ========== ============
Base System          200 mW        17 mA
Wifi                 330 mW        28 mA
Modem                170 mW        13 mA
GPS                  230 mW        19 mA
**Total**        **930 mW**    **78 mA**
================ ========== ============

This adds up to:

  - ~  22 Wh  or   2 Ah  / day
  - ~ 156 Wh  or  13 Ah  / week
  - ~ 680 Wh  or  57 Ah  / month

Note that depending on the vehicle type, the module may also need to wake up the ECU
periodically to retrieve the vehicle status. Check the vehicle specific documentation
sections for hints on the power usage for this and options to avoid or reduce this.
