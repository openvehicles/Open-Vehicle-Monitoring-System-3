The OVMS (Open Vehicle Monitoring System) team is a group of enthusiasts who are developing a means to remotely communicate with our cars, and are having fun while doing it.
 
The OVMS module is a low-cost hardware device that you install in your car simply by installing a SIM card, connecting the module to your car's Diagnostic port connector, and optionally positioning a cellular antenna. Once connected, the OVMS module enables remote control and monitoring of your car.
