## Upstream PR queue

Break the `climate-control` branch into small focused PRs in this order (each depends on the previous being merged):

| # | PR | Status | Blocker |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Decode-only baseline — all `IncomingFrameCan3`/`Can2` metric decodes, no bus writes | ready | — |
| 2 | `CommandWakeup` — KCAN NM wake sequence | ready | PR 1 merged |
| 3 | `CommandClimateControl` — clima start/stop via BAP | blocked | port 0x19 temp encoding (see below) |
| 4 | OCU heartbeat one-shot actions — horn, indicators, panic, mirror fold | ready | PR 2 merged |
| 5 | `CommandLock` / `CommandUnlock` | blocked | auth bytes not captured (see below) |
| 6 | User guide (`docs/index.rst`) — required by maintainer before any PR merges | not started | — |

Each PR must: pass native test suite · reference relevant `docs/` RE notes · English user-facing strings only · single log tag `v-vwegolf` · no metric defaults in constructor.

## Open items

### Startup sentinel filters missing (multiple frames)

Confirmed from `tests/logs-capture2.md` — the first burst of frames after every wake-up
contains invalid sentinel values that get written to persistent metrics:

| Frame | Sentinel value | Symptom |
|---|---|---|
| `0x0191` | `I=2047.0A`, `V=1023.50V` | Garbage current/voltage on boot |
| `0x059E` | `bat_temp=87.0°C` | 0xFF raw, max of decode range |
| `0x05CA` | `bat_capacity=102.3 kWh` | Near max of decode range |
| `0x05EA` | `clima_cabin=62.2°C` | Near max of decode range |
| `0x06B5` | `solar_sensor=164.6°C`, `air_sensor=62.2°C` | Way over physical range |

**Fix pattern:** same as existing SoC (0x131) and cabin temp (0x066E) filters — check for
max/sentinel raw value before decoding and `break` early.

### CCS charge type not detected

During active CCS DC fast charging, bits [3:2] of `0x0594` d[5] = 0x00 (no connector type).
`v.c.type` stays undefined. The CCS type indicator is elsewhere in the frame — d[3] and d[5]
raw bytes are now logged at VERBOSE to identify it on the next CCS session.

**Also noted:** `0x0594` default case previously wrote `"undefined"` string to the metric,
overwriting any previously-set type on every idle frame. Fixed to `break` instead.

**To resolve:** capture verbose log during active CCS charging and look for `d[3]=xx d[5]=xx`
values that differ from the non-charging baseline (`d[3]=03 d[5]=00`).

### Odometer reads 5936 km at startup (decode bug suspected)

`tests/logs-capture2.md` shows `0x06B7 odo=5936 km` in the first wake-up burst vs known
odometer of ~90650 km. Either a startup sentinel in this frame or a decode bug. Needs
investigation against a known-good odometer reading captured mid-session (not first-burst).

### Temperature encoding for BAP port 0x19 (blocks clima PR)

Frame 2 byte 6 is hardcoded to `0x20` (thomasakarlsen default). Port 0x16 (schedule) uses
`byte = celsius + 35` (20°C → `0x37`). Port 0x19 may differ — `0x20` decodes as 32°C under
that formula, which is wrong.

**To resolve:** two back-to-back `climatecontrol on` commands with different `xvg cc_temp`
values (e.g. 18°C and 22°C). Diff Frame 2 byte 6 between captures. If the ECU echoes the
setpoint in `0x17330110` port 0x1B, that confirms the encoding.

### Lock / unlock auth bytes (blocks lock PR)

`CommandLock` / `CommandUnlock` set the action bits in `0x5A7` but the gateway likely requires
additional authentication bytes alongside the action bit. Without them the command is ignored.

**To resolve:** capture the OEM app or key fob locking the car while OVMS is in monitor mode.
Diff the `0x5A7` frame against the idle keepalive to identify the auth pattern.

### GPS sign bits — S/W hemisphere unconfirmed

Sign bits inferred from bit layout: bit 55 (`d[6]` MSB) = lat sign, bit 56 (`d[7]` bit 0) = lon sign.
Confirmed 0 for known N/E location (Norway). Firmware applies them; `vwegolf.dbc` marks them
as inferred.

**To resolve:** any capture from a Southern or Western hemisphere location.

### `CommandWakeup` second frame necessity unclear

The `0x1B000067` NM presence frame is sent as part of `CommandWakeup` but it is not confirmed
whether it is actually required. A controlled test with only the first frame would clarify.

### `m_climate_on_battery` flag not sent

The "allow climatisation on battery" config (`xvg cc_on_battery`) is read but never included
in the BAP command frames. The bit/byte in the port 0x19 payload is not yet identified.

**To resolve:** capture a start command with the flag toggled. Diff against a standard start.

### Charging current frame not identified

`ms_v_charge_current` and `ms_v_charge_power` are never set. `0x0191` is motor/inverter only
(zero during charging). The OBC charge current lives on a different KCAN frame not yet found.

**To resolve:** dedicated charging session capture. Filter for frames only active when the
`ChargeInProgress` bit in `0x0594` is set. Candidates will be frames absent in parked-not-charging
baseline. Once identified, decode in `IncomingFrameCan3`, set `ms_v_charge_current` and
`ms_v_charge_power`, add signal to `vwegolf.dbc`.

## Remaining captures needed

### Capture 5 — Cabin temp in remote mode

**Goal:** identify cabin temp source when car is parked and clima is running via OVMS with
ignition off. In ignition-on mode it comes from `0x17330110` node 0x01 port 0x1B. May be
the same frame remotely or may differ.

**Sequence:** `climatecontrol on` → wait for blower → capture KCAN 2–3 min. Note actual
cabin temp with a thermometer for ground truth.

**What to look for:** any frame with a value that warms from ambient toward setpoint over
5–10 min; whether `0x17330110` port 0x1B is present and tracking when ignition is off.

### Capture 6 — Natural timer expiry

**Goal:** see what the ECU sends when the 10-minute clima timer expires on its own.

**Sequence:** start clima, wait for auto-stop.

**What to look for:** port 0x1a header byte reverting from `c2` to `c0`; final stop
notification; whether status payloads (`00 00 04`, `02 00 04`) change.

### Capture 7 — Port 0x19 temperature encoding

See open item above. Needed to unblock the clima PR.

### Capture 8 — Charging current (Type 2 AC only)

See open item above. Must be **Type 2 AC** — CCS DC fast charging keeps KCAN completely
silent (no frames visible to OVMS during the session). AC charging goes through the
internal OBC which does appear on KCAN.

### Capture 9 — Lock / unlock auth bytes

See open item above.

## High-value gaps (worth implementing next)

1. `v.c.current` / `v.c.power` — OBC charge current — Capture 8
2. `v.e.cabintemp` / `v.e.temp` — remote-mode cabin/ambient temp — Capture 5
3. `v.e.heating` / `v.e.cooling` — derivable once cabintemp is known
4. `v.c.limit.soc` — BAP profile 0x25 already RE'd, implementable now
5. `v.b.soh` — state of health — probably accessible via UDS on BMS ECU
6. `v.t.pressure` — TPMS alerts — frame not yet identified
